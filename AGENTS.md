# Presentations: rules for agents

Presentations is a Lazurio module template: a library of HTML presentations
built from a structured source, with first-slide previews, presenting,
printing to 16:9 PDF pages, local video, personal versions for a prospect
and a brief for creating decks with the user's own Agent. Its source and
releases live in `LazurioTemplates/presentations`. The App and the sample
deck speak Czech and English; the code and documentation are English. It is
MIT licensed. All bundled content is fictional (the invented company
Example).

## Skills

Use the module's skills (`.agents/skills/`, mirrored in `.claude/skills/`):

- `deck-from-sources`: a new deck from the person's approved sources.
- `deck-personal-version`: a personal link for one prospect. Ask first,
  every time; store nothing.
- `deck-add-slide`: one more slide of a given type.

Keep both skill folders identical; a test checks it.

## Shape of the module

- `lazurio.module.json` declares one App, `app/v1` (generation v1: no data
  layer of its own). Decks are Git files, not records in a database.
- `app/v1` is one Bun server (`src/server.ts`) that serves the React
  library, a same-origin read-only API, the decks and derived PDFs.
  Listener settings come only from module-kit `listener("web")`.
- From `main` Lazurio runs the built version: `build` writes the client to
  `dist`, and `start` runs the same server with `NODE_ENV=production`,
  serving the installed build from `LAZURIO_RUNTIME_BUILD_OUTPUT`. A
  development run (`dev`) lets Bun bundle the client itself. The preparation
  only checks that dependencies are installed; it never builds.
- A deck: `data/v1/decks/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/deck.source.json` and its
  `media/`. `bun run deck:build` writes `index.html`,
  `index.<language>.html`, `deck.meta.json` and `assets/`; never edit those
  by hand. The format is in [docs/slide-types.md](docs/slide-types.md).
  A hand-written deck (an `index.html` without a source) still works.
- Each deck needs a real first-slide JPEG per language in
  `app/v1/public/previews/` (`<slug>.jpg`, `<slug>.<language>.jpg`); the
  client build refuses a deck without one.
- Derived PDFs go to `generated/v1/decks/<slug>/exports/`. The browser
  prints them; the App never generates or stores PDFs itself.
- The library's language: `?lang=`, else the `locale` of
  `/.lazurio/shell.json` where the App's origin answers it, else
  `app/v1/src/instance.ts`. Every text is in `app/v1/src/ui-app/i18n.ts`
  (library) and `app/v1/src/deck/messages.ts` (deck controls), in both
  languages; never mix languages on one screen.
- The look of decks comes from `design-system/` (a subtree merge of a
  release of `LazurioTemplates/design-system`; never edit it here, take a
  newer release by merging its tag). The library keeps the frozen Lazurio
  snapshot in `app/v1/public/lazurio/`; never edit it either. See
  [docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md).

## Stack

Stack profile `app@2026.11` of Lazurio: Bun 1.4.4, TypeScript 7.0.2, Biome
2.6.4, Vite 8.3.5, React 19.3.1, `bun test`, `@lazurio/module-kit` v0.2.0.
Every dependency has an exact version and `bun.lock` is committed. Change
the stack only through a profile release or a generation change, see
[docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md).

## Working on the module

- Work in a task worktree under `.worktrees/` and a pull request. Never push
  to `main`.
- One gate: in `app/v1`, `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and
  `bun run check` (type check, Biome and all tests: the deck sources against
  their built files, both languages, the client build, the development run
  and the built version). CI runs the same.
- For a UI or deck change, also open the App and the deck in a browser, in
  both languages, and check the library, the detail, the personal version,
  the Agent brief, presenting and the print preview.
- No cross-repository runtime imports, no `.env*`, no CDN fonts, no network
  calls and no storage from decks.
- Facts, numbers, quotes, names and logos on slides only from the person's
  approved sources. Media own or licensed, recorded in the deck's
  `media/README.md`; music and effects only with a verified license.
- Keep `NOTICE` current when fonts, assets or other third-party files enter
  the tree.

## Releases and adoption

- Releases follow [docs/release.md](docs/release.md): annotated tag
  `v<semver>` and a GitHub Release, each only on the owner's explicit
  instruction. The release version is independent of the App generation.
- Adoption into another Organization follows [docs/adoption.md](docs/adoption.md);
  the adopted module keeps its own identity and lease. The values in
  `lazurio.module.json` and `app/v1/package.json` here are placeholders
  (`REPLACE-WITH-ORG-NAME`, `replace-with-org-slug-presentations-v1`, port
  20000); the scaffold of the adopting Organization replaces them.
