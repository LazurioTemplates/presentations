# Changelog

The release version (semver) is independent of the app generation
(`app/v1`).

## 0.2.0 — proposed, not released

Presentations becomes a full presentation module: decks built from a short
structured source, eleven slide types, local video, personal versions for a
prospect, Czech and English, the look of the module's design system and
skills for agents. The App stays generation `app/v1` and stack profile
`app@2026.11`; nothing is migrated. Builds on 0.1.1.

### Added

- **Decks from source.** `data/v1/decks/<slug>/deck.source.json`
  (`lazurio.presentation.source.v1`) with its `media/`; `bun run deck:build`
  validates it (each error names its field) and writes `index.html`,
  `index.<language>.html`, `deck.meta.json` and `assets/`;
  `bun run deck:check` and a test keep the built files equal to the source.
  Bun and TypeScript only.
- **Eleven slide types**: title, section, problem, quote, options (models
  and variants), case study, timeline, metrics with a growth chart, video,
  appendix and closing ([docs/slide-types.md](docs/slide-types.md)).
- **Presenting**: a 1920 × 1080 stage fitted to the window, keys, swipe,
  full screen, the slide in the address, print to one 16:9 page per slide,
  speaker notes kept out of sight.
- **Video slides** with local files: muted when the slide opens, stopped
  when it closes, sound only with its button and only for a video that has
  sound, nothing with reduced motion, the poster in print, captions per
  language.
- **Personal version**: `?for=<name>&org=<organization>` (in Czech also
  `?pro=` and `&firma=`) shows "Prepared for …" on the title and closing
  slides; nothing is stored. The library's detail builds the link.
- **Czech and English**: the library follows `?lang=`, else the `locale`
  of `/.lazurio/shell.json`, else `app/v1/src/instance.ts` (Czech by
  default); a deck can carry both languages, each with its own page,
  metadata and first-slide preview, and a switch between them. The API takes
  `?lang=`.
- **Design system**: `design-system/` is a subtree merge of
  `LazurioTemplates/design-system` v1.0.0; decks take its colour roles, type
  scale and spacing through its own `tokens.ts`, at slide scale, with the
  template's local fonts. A newer release arrives as a merge of its tag.
- **Skills for agents** in `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`:
  `deck-from-sources`, `deck-personal-version`, `deck-add-slide`.
- **Sample deck** of the invented company Example (an office coffee offer),
  every slide type in Czech and English, with a text-free, silent animation
  made for this template.
- Marketplace screens per language in `docs/screenshots/cs/` and
  `docs/screenshots/en/`.
- Tests: the deck source, the build and its drift, escaping, the link
  parameters, both languages, the sample deck, previews per language and
  the template contract (license, documents, exact versions, screens,
  skills, the design system subtree, paths that check out on Windows).

### Changed

- The library's words come from `app/v1/src/ui-app/i18n.ts`; the "Vytvořit
  s Agentem" brief names the skill `deck-from-sources` and `deck:build`.
- A preview per language: `<slug>.<language>.jpg` beside `<slug>.jpg` for
  every further language of a deck.
- `docs/design-system.md` describes both looks: the decks from the design
  system, the library from the Lazurio snapshot.

### Removed

- The four-slide starter `2026-10-11-project-proposal` and its preview; the
  sample deck replaces it. Hand-written decks keep working.
- The screens of 0.1 in `docs/screenshots/*.webp` (now per language).

### For adopted modules

Take 0.1.1 first, then merge the tag `v0.2.0` as
[docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md#from-01x-to-020) describes: keep your
identity and decks, set the language in `app/v1/src/instance.ts`, decide
whether to keep the sample deck, and run `bun run deck:build` and
`bun run check`.

## 0.1.1 — proposed, not released

A fix release: Lazurio runs the built version from `main` instead of the
development server. The App stays generation `app/v1` and stack profile
`app@2026.11`.

### Fixed

- The built version from `main` (Lazurio Module Standard): `lazurio.runtime`
  declares `start_script: start` and `build_output: dist` beside
  `build_script: build`. From `main` Lazurio builds the client into `dist`
  and starts the server with `NODE_ENV=production`, which serves the
  installed build from `LAZURIO_RUNTIME_BUILD_OUTPUT` (the package's own
  `dist/` in a local production run). A development run lets Bun bundle the
  client (HTML import with hot reload) and serves `public/` beside it.
- The preparation no longer builds: `check:prepared` checks only that the
  dependencies are installed, and `prepare:app` is gone. The first-slide
  preview check runs in the client build.
- The health path is `/api/health`, which answers from the server in both
  runs and refuses a foreign Host.
- `docs/adoption.md` (issue #3): the name check reads the owner of
  `gh api repos/<Organization>/<name>`, because GitHub redirects a moved
  repository; the release check compares the tag with the recorded commit,
  since the registry records no artifact digest yet; the module is created
  with `--teams` and a dry run first; the Lazurio release needed for the
  built version (LazurioPlatform v0.1.11 or newer) is named.
- `docs/release.md` and `docs/marketplace.md` no longer promise an archive
  digest in the registry entry.

### For adopted modules

Merge the tag `v0.1.1`. Keep your identity in `lazurio.module.json` and
`lazurio.runtime` (`id`, `company`, `module`); take the scripts,
`start_script`, `build_output`, the health path and the preparation from the
template. If your module added its own `prepare:app` steps, move a build into
`build` and keep only idempotent preparation in a `prepare_script`. After the
merge, `bun run check` in `app/v1`; after the person merges, start the module
from `main` and check the library in the browser.
